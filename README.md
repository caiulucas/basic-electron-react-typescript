## Electron + TypeScript + React

This boilerplate is using [diego3g/electron-typescript-react](https://github.com/diego3g/electron-typescript-react) as base.
If you want something with styled-components, linting and tests with jest, just go there. 

### Differences between this boilerplate and the diego3g's version
* css support added
* svg support added
* jest removed
* eslint removed
* styled-components removed

The idea of this boilerplate is to be as simple as it can using this three technologies. My thought is to give the developer maximum freedom to choose their own way to write code.
